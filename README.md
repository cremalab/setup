# Fresh Macbook setup scripts

See the comments in the `.sh` files to find out what they install. Comment out anything you don't want. Then run them.

* `basic.sh` — Basic tools and programs that most or all of us use (Homebrew, Slack, Harvest, _et c._)
* `developer.sh` — Developer tools

You should run `basic.sh` first or you may have a bad time.

**See this repo's [Wiki](https://github.com/cremalab/setup/wiki) for more info about tools and processes.**
